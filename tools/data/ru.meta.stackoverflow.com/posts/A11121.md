<h3>How do I use the Reopen votes queue?</h3>
<p><em>Access earned at $Privilege-CloseQuestion reputation</em><br />
Any closed question that has received one reopen vote gets added to this queue,
as well as any question edited within 70 days since its closure.
Before reviewing in this queue, you should be familiar with what sorts
of questions should and should not be closed. To find that
information, see the following two pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="/help/closed-questions">Closed question help article</a> is a
network-wide guide for the primary reasons questions should be closed.
This generally happens when a question:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>is a duplicate of an existing question on the site.</p>
</li>
<li><p>needs additional details or clarity to be answered.</p>
</li>
<li><p>needs to be more focused, as the existing question is too broad.</p>
</li>
<li><p>is an opinion-based question that doesn’t have an objectively correct answer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><a href="/help/on-topic">On topic article</a> is a site-specific guide to
what types of questions are on and off topic on this site. This page
will differ on each site on the Network.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Basic workflow</h2>
<p>Evaluate the question as it is now. Review any edits that may have been made after the question was closed and any comments
on the question. If edits were made but are insufficient to reopen the
question, consider leaving a comment explaining why.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Leave closed</strong> if close reason(s) still apply. Do not reopen if the
specific reason for closure no longer applies, but the question should
still be closed. Consider leaving a comment to explain why the question should remain closed, particularly if the reason is different than what appears in the banner.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Edit and reopen</strong> if you can resolve issues with the
question yourself, and these edits are sufficient for the post to be
reopened. Avoid making minor edits that don’t impact whether the post
should be reopened.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Reopen</strong> if issues with the question have been
resolved, or if it was incorrectly closed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Skip</strong> if you're not sure
whether the question should be reopened.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You may want to restrict which questions you are shown to subjects you are familiar with by filtering reviews by tags you have
experience in. You can do this by clicking “Filter” in the top section
of a review task. When in doubt, choose Skip.</p>
