<p>While we understand that there is some frustration and questions about potential moderator misconduct, historically, the Community Team manages a process for handling formal complaints against moderators. For this reason, if you have concerns about moderators' actions, we encourage you to use the &quot;<a href="https://ru.meta.stackoverflow.com/contact">Contact Us</a>&quot; option so we can properly investigate and utilize this process if necessary.</p>
<p>We value privacy in these situations, so there won't be any public announcements regarding outcomes or whether a conduct review has been initiated.</p>
<p>Additionally, while it's perfectly okay to use Meta for discussing moderator actions, we are noticing that the current conversation might not be as productive as it could be. As such, we kindly ask moderators to lock this post temporarily and appreciate your patience as we investigate further.</p>
