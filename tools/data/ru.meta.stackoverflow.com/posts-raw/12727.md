<p>This feels bad and I also want to say &quot;Спасибо, Николай!&quot;</p>
<p>I had the pleasure to meet Nicolas some years ago. While walking through Barcelona, where he was spending his holidays, we talked about many topics. I was deeply impressed by his curiosity, his desire to learn, and I specially liked his willingness to transfer all his experiences to Stack Overflow, to improve the site and how it helps so many people.</p>
<p>Nicolas, you created something very big and I am sure you will continue to do great things.</p>
<p>All the best!</p>
